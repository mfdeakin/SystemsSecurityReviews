\section{Summary}
This paper developed a set of machine learning methods to try and identify URL's which host malicious exploit kits.
The authors looked at several kits to try and determine what relevant features might be used to identify whether a website was malicious or not.
\section{Exploit Kits}
11 prominent exploit kits were used to determine potentially relevant features and to create a classifier based on them.

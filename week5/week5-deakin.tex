\section{Summary}
This paper gave an overview of the implementation of a phone system honeypot.
It differentiated the implementation from traditional honeypots by addressing specific challenges inherent in detecting new sources of illegitimate phone use.
These challenges included legal issues, infrastructure issues, and dataset issues.\\
Legal issues were largely a result of two-party consent laws, which require both parties consent to record phone calls.
Though these laws are only in some states, they must still be respected by a phoneypot in a state without them in case the caller is in one with them.
This prevents a high level of interaction with the caller by the phoneypot, making it more difficult to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate phone uses.\\
There are several issues related to the infrastructure.
Probably the largest is that the space of phone numbers is limited.

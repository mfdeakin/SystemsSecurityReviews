\section{Summary}
This paper focused on the viability of creating programs which did not subvert the programs control flow.
It did so by exploiting some of the same vulnerabilities that control flow attacks did, but using them to instead corrupt data structures which would allow the attacker to escalate their privileges through normal control flow.
Several of these exploits were demonstrated, and current defenses were evaluated to see if they would have been prevented or detected.
